🌍 Project Overview

TakeItFree is a community-driven social sharing platform where people give away items they no longer need — completely free — while building real human connections.

It combines:
	•	Social media experience (feeds, profiles, stories)
	•	Local community sharing
	•	Trust-based identity
	•	Zero-selling culture

Unlike traditional marketplaces, TakeItFree focuses on generosity, storytelling, and meaningful interaction — not transactions.

	•	Build trust through verified identities
	•	Make giving social, emotional, and rewarding
	•	Deliver a modern experience similar to Instagram

This creates a modern, engaging content experience — not just listings.

Instead of chaotic DMs:

Keeps everything transparent and polite.
